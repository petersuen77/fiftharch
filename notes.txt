==================================
RUNNING LOCALLY

* Run with "npm run dev" instead of "vercel dev" because the latter causes CORS errors. 

* If necessary, KV Environment Variables can be set in command line:

CMD shell
Set KV_REST_API_URL="https://immortal-tetra-33951.kv.vercel-storage.com"
Set KV_REST_API_TOKEN="AYSfASQgNDVlYjMzYmUtMGJjNy00YWFkLWIyOGUtODMxMGVjMzUwZDRjZmIyNmFkMTU3MTk5NDgwY2EwY2UwMDZiMTQyN2E3ZTE="

Power shell
$env:KV_REST_API_URL="https://immortal-tetra-33951.kv.vercel-storage.com"
$env:KV_REST_API_TOKEN="AYSfASQgNDVlYjMzYmUtMGJjNy00YWFkLWIyOGUtODMxMGVjMzUwZDRjZmIyNmFkMTU3MTk5NDgwY2EwY2UwMDZiMTQyN2E3ZTE="

==================================
DEPLOYMENT

* Check and set production environment variables in Vercel; make sure they are tied to the Vercel fiftharch project.

* Use "vercel --prod" to deploy from cmd window


==================================
ENVIRONMENT SETUP

* Install Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Install "Svelte for VS Code" and "Tailwind CSS IntelliSense".

* Install Git: https://git-scm.com/download.

* Install node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer), which seems to also include npm (otherwise install npm).

* Install latest PowerShell on Windows and restart.

* Set CNAME record in godaddy.com for dev.fiftharch.com to point to "cname.vercel-dns.com.".

* In Vercel, start with a sveltekit/KV project template and clone it, calling it fiftharch. This will automatically create a new github repository called fiftharch.

* In VSCode, log into the github account and clone the repository. This will create the local folder for the repository. 
  https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/github#_getting-started-with-github-pull-requests-and-issues

    * Run "npm install" to install all package dependencies.
    * Run "vercel login" with github credentials.
    * Run "vercel link" to link to fifharch project.
    * Run "vercel env pull" to get online Vercel env variables into local .env file.
