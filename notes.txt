==================================
RUNNING LOCALLY

* Run with "npm run dev" instead of "vercel dev" because the latter causes CORS errors. 

* However, running without "vercel dev" causes @vercel/kv to not work (bc KV env variables are not loaded right). See solution below.

* KV Environment Variables
- Set KV variables in CMD console because they are not read from .env or .env.development.local files right by Vite

CMD shell
Set KV_REST_API_URL="https://immortal-tetra-33951.kv.vercel-storage.com"
Set KV_REST_API_TOKEN="AYSfASQgNDVlYjMzYmUtMGJjNy00YWFkLWIyOGUtODMxMGVjMzUwZDRjZmIyNmFkMTU3MTk5NDgwY2EwY2UwMDZiMTQyN2E3ZTE="

Power shell
$env:KV_REST_API_URL="https://immortal-tetra-33951.kv.vercel-storage.com"
$env:KV_REST_API_TOKEN="AYSfASQgNDVlYjMzYmUtMGJjNy00YWFkLWIyOGUtODMxMGVjMzUwZDRjZmIyNmFkMTU3MTk5NDgwY2EwY2UwMDZiMTQyN2E3ZTE="

==================================
DEPLOYMENT

* Set production environment variables in Vercel; make sure they are tied to the Vercel fiftharch project.

* Use "vercel --prod" to deploy

==================================
LOCAL ENVIRONMENT SETUP

* Download & install Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Install "Svelte for VS Code" and "Tailwind CSS IntelliSense".

* Setup Git: https://git-scm.com/download. Clone fiftharch Github repo: https://github.com/petersuen77/fiftharch.git. Branch it locally. 
    * Also make sure you have a github account.

* Install node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer), which seems to also include npm (otherwise install npm).

* Install latest PowerShell on Windows and restart.

* In VScode terminal (can be PowerShell) 
    * Run "npm install" to install all package dependencies.
    * Run "vercel login" with github credentials.
    * Run "vercel env pull" to get online Vercel env variables into local .env file.
